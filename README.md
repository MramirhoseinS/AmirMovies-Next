AmirMovies is a project created to showcase my skills in web development. It features a collection of movies and related information, designed to provide an engaging user experience. I built this site as part of a personal project to demonstrate my abilities in React and Next.js.
In this project, I utilized Redux and the built-in Next.jsAPI to enhance the user experience and improve the website's performance.
